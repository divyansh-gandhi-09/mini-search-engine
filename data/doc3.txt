Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of AI that gives machines 
the ability to read, understand, and derive meaning from human languages.
It combines computational linguistics with statistical, 
machine learning, and deep learning models.
Git is a distributed version control system.
It tracks changes in source code during development.
Repositories can be local or hosted on platforms like GitHub.
`git init`, `git add`, and `git commit` are basic commands.
Branches allow parallel development.
Merging and rebasing integrate changes.
Commits have hashes that ensure history integrity.
