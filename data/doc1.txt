Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines that 
can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These include things like visual 
perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.
Databases store and manage structured data.
SQL is used to query relational databases.
Tables consist of rows and columns.
Indexes improve data retrieval speed.
Normalization avoids data redundancy.
NoSQL databases offer flexibility for unstructured data.
