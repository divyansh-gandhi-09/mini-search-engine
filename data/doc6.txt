Algorithms are a set of instructions for solving problems.
Sorting and searching are classic algorithm categories.
QuickSort, MergeSort, and BubbleSort are common sorting algorithms.
Binary search is efficient for sorted arrays.
Time complexity helps evaluate algorithm efficiency.
Big O notation expresses worst-case performance.
Recursive and iterative approaches can solve similar problems.
