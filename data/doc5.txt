Data structures help in organizing data efficiently.
Common types include arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
Trees and graphs are advanced data structures.
A stack follows LIFO, while a queue follows FIFO.
Binary search trees allow fast lookup and insertion.
Graphs are used to model networks like maps and social media.
Choosing the right data structure improves performance.
