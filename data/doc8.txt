Machine learning enables computers to learn from data.
Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning are key types.
Neural networks mimic human brain structures.
Training data is used to adjust model parameters.
Overfitting and underfitting are common challenges.
Scikit-learn and TensorFlow are popular ML libraries.
Feature engineering improves model accuracy.
